## Developer Blog

The blog begins with a series on event sourcing. The goal of this series is to
tell a story of our experiences creating and maintaining banking software using
an event sourced pattern. All articles should share common themes:

* Be concise
    - These articles should convey lots of information, with minimal fluff.
    - Focus on code examples and brief explanations.
    - Distribute explanation into comments within code blocks as well.
* Never remove the user's humor
    - The user has bits of dry humor all around, please don't remove them.
* Provide code examples
    - Use pydantic types where possible

### Each blog entry should initially start with the following structure:

1. **Introduction / Motivation**
2. **Terminology Clarification**
3. **Real-World Scenarios / Use Cases**
4. **Technical Deep Dive**
5. **Performance Considerations**
6. **Testing Strategies**
7. **Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them**
8. **Summary / Conclusion**
9. **Further Reading / References**
10. **FAQ**
11. **Tools and Libraries**
12. **Call to Action**
